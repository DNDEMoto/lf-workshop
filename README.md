# Lingua Franca Workshop
The objective of this workshop is to get familiar with basic features of Lingua Franca. We will ll go a step further to discuss how it can be applied for the development of time critical software applications. 

We recommend visiting the [Lingua Franca](https://www.lf-lang.org/) project page for more details.



## Development Environment

We have created two develop environments for you to try the workshop examples. [Gitpod](http://gitpod.io) and [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/) allow you to launch the containerized environment and support editing in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Browser based or Desktop version).

**You are responsible for the costs incurred for working on both these environments. Kindly review the pricing and make sure you maximize your free credits as an individual user.**

 - [GitHub Codespaces Pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)
 - [Gitpod Pricing](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing)

If you are not comfortable with the above environments, please follow the links below to build the development environment on your compute machine.
